A font based on the font used in Minecraft.

Supports every language that the 8x8/9x12 font used in Minecraft supports.

(so not Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.)

(upside down English is **not** included.)

Also some support for (U)CSUR, namely Sitelen Pona and Standard Galactic Alphabet.

Plus some emoji support.

It also kerns for better flow.

**You will not be able to use this in vanilla Minecraft. You will have to use a mod like [Caxton](https://modrinth.com/mod/caxton).**
